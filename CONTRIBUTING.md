# Contributing policy

First of all, thank you for contributing to **reGEN**! It helps me focus on other my projects or just relax.

When contributing, please, follow contribution policy, that is written here:

- README changes are allowed, but changing contribution policy or security policy is not allowed.
- When changing translation or readme, please, make sure you have no typos.
